## Overview

This project was developed as Part 1 of the final assessment for the course ***PPGEEC2318 - Machine Learning***. The primary objective of this initial phase was to design four versions to a convolutional neural network for the classification of cloud types based on ground-level imagery. Before proceeding, a brief explanation of clouds and their classifications is provided.

### Clouds and Their Classifications

Clouds are visible collections of water droplets, ice particles, or a combination of both, suspended in the atmosphere. They often also contain particles such as dust, smoke, and industrial residues. Clouds are continuously evolving, frequently changing their shape, size, and appearance, which are mainly determined by two properties: luminance‚Äîthe amount of light reflected, transmitted, or scattered by cloud particles‚Äîand color, influenced by incident light from natural (Sun or Moon) or artificial sources (city lights).

Clouds are classified into three main categories: Upper, Middle, and Lower. The classification is based on the altitude at which the **clouds base** are found. Table 1 presents the most frequent vertical distribution of clouds in the three main regions of the Earth:

```
Table 1 - Most Frequent Vertical Distribution of Clouds

| Layer    | Polar Regions | Temperate Regions | Tropical Region | 
|----------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Upper    | 3 to 8 km     | 5 to 13 km        | 6 to 18 km      |
| Middle   | 2 to 4 km     | 2 to 7 km         | 2 to 8 km       |
| Lower    | up to 2 km    | up to 2 km        | up to 2 km      |

Along with their altitude, clouds are also classified based on their shape, which can be seen in Figure 1.

As can be seen in Figure 1, only two types of clouds can produce precipitation: cumulonimbus and nimbostratus. Cumulonimbus clouds are characterized by their tall, vertical shape and are associated with thunderstorms, while nimbostratus clouds are characterized by their flat, horizontal shape and are associated with persistent, widespread precipitation.

## Dataset

* **Original Source**: [Thitinan Kliangsuwan. Cloud Type Classification 3, 2022.](https://kaggle.com/competitions/cloud-type-classification-3) and [Howard-Cloud-X](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imbikramsaha/howard-cloudx).

The two original datasets showed several inconsistencies regarding the previously labeled cloud types. Therefore, a manual selection of images was necessary to obtain the best dataset for training and validation. Additionally, due to the similarity between some cloud classes, five types were selected along with the ‚ÄúClear Sky‚Äù class. The chosen classes were: Cirrus, Altocumulus, Cumulonimbus, Cumulus, Nimbostratus, and Clear Sky.

Figure 2 shows a randomly chosen sample from each class, selected from the training data.

Afther this process, the final dataset had a total of 656 images for train and 124 for validation.

## Model Description - Base Model

The CNN2 model is a simple convolutional neural network tailored for image classification tasks with 6 output classes. Its architecture includes:

* **Input**: RGB images (3 channels)

* **Convolutional Layers**: Two convolutional layers, each followed by ```ReLU``` activation and 2√ó2 ```Max Pooling``` to extract features and reduce dimensionality;

* **Dropout**: Optional dropout layers can be applied for regularization;

* **Fully Connected Layers**: One hidden (50 units) and one output layer (6 units for class scores);

* **Forward Pass**: Data flows sequentially through the featurizer (convolutions and pooling) and the classifier (fully connected layers);

* **Loss Function**: Cross-Entropy Loss (```nn.CrossEntropyLoss```), suitable for multi-class classification

* **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer (```torch.optim.Adam```), applied to all model parameters;

* **Batch Size**: 16;

* **Epochs**: 10;

* **Validation Strategy**: A validation split was used to monitor model performance during training.

During training, loss values were monitored across epochs for traing and validation (Figure 3), as you can see below and a confusion matrix was computed to evaluate model performance.
